# discord2discord

discord2discord is a very simple bridge between two Discord channels.

# But why?

I don't know, I was bored.

# How to get it working?

  - Edit "Channel_ID1" and "Channel_ID2" with your own Channel IDs.
  - Edit "token" at the end with your own Discord bot token.
     -  Look at https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2 for more information.

# Issues

This bot has some issues. I'll fix them when I have some motivation.
- The code is still not that good, I guess
- Probably some other stuff.

# Need help? Ask me, Simon#2464 on Discord.
