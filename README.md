# discord2discord

discord2discord is a very simple bridge between two Discord channels.

# How to get it working?

  - Edit "Channel_ID" with the Channel ID of a server that the bot can access.
  - Edit "token" at the end with your own Discord bot token.
     -  Look at https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2 for more              information.

# Issues

This bot has some issues. I'll fix them when I have some motivation.
- Right now it's just a Discord-->Discord bridge. So it doesn't work in both         was yet.
- The bot mirrors every message in the channel with the Channel_ID
- Propably some other issues.
